# pie-elements

The pie elements package set.

Elements are in `packages`.


## lerna


### issues 

* whilst publishing w/ lerna will bump dependencies in the main packages, it won't do so for internal pie packages (ie controller/configure).

# install

```shell
npm install -g lerna # don't use for now
npm install
```

# develop

* the packages use `independent` versioning, meaning that a change in 1 package won't bump another package's version.
* use [conventional commits syntax][ccs] when commiting, lerna will detect the appropriate version bump.

# running

### info
```shell
cd packages/multiple-choice
pie info
```
Sometimes you want to link in libraries to the config ui: 

```
cd docs/demo/.pie/.configure
npm link @pie-libs/editable-html # will link up the local editable-html package
```

# release/publish

```bash
lerna publish --conventional-commits # will add conventional commits to each packages CHANGELOG.md
# you can add --skip-npm and/or --skip-git if you want to bypass publishing to either.
```

> TODO: we need to set up a flow where we merge `develop` -> `master` then run the publish cmd.

### dependencies
* [lerna js][lerna] for handling multiple packages in a mono repo
* [pie][pie] to test/build the pies
